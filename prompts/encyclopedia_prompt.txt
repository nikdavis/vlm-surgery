JOHN I. OF

in the following year and assisted Czarniecki in his difficult
task of expelling Charles X of Sweden from the central Polish
provinces. For his subsequent services to King John Casimir,
especially in the Ukraime against the Tatars and Cossacks,
he received the grand baton of the crown, or commandership-
in-chief (1668). He had already (1665) succeeded Czarniecki
as actmg commander-in-chief. Sobieski had well earned
these distmctions by his extraordinary military capacity, but
he was now to exhibit a less pleasing side of his character. He
was in fact a typical representative of the unscrupulous self-
seeking Polish magnates of the 17th century who were always
ready to sacrifice everything, their country included, to their
own private ambition. At the election diet of 1669 he accepted
large bribes from Louis XIV. to support one of the French candi-
dates; after the election of Michael Wisniowiecki (June 10,
1669) he openly conspired, again in the French interest, against
his lawful sovereign, and that too at the very time when
the Turk was ravaging the southern frontier of the republic.
Michael was the feeblest monarch the Poles could have placed
upon the throne, and Sobieski deliberately attempted to make
government of any kind impossible. He formed a league with
the pmmate Prazmowski and other traitors to dethrone the
king, when (1670) the plot was discovered and participation
in it repudiated by Lous XIV., the traitors sought the help of
the elector of Brandenburg against their own justly indignant
countrymen. Two years later the same traitors again conspired
against the king, at the very time when the Turks had defeated
Sobieski’s unsupported heutenant, Luzecki, at Czertwerty-
worska and captured the fortress of Kamieniec (Kamenetz-
Podolsk1y), the key of south-eastern Poland, while Lemberg was
only saved by the valour of Elias Lancki. The unhappy king
did the only thing possible in the circumstances. He summoned
the iuszenra pospolite, or national armed assembly, but it failed
to assemble in time, whereupon Michael was constrained to
sign the disgraceful peace of Buczacz (Oct. 17, 1672) whereby
Poland ceded to the Porte the whole of the Ukraine with Podolia
and Kamieniec. Aroused to duty by a series of disasters for
which he himself was primanly responsible, Sobieski now
hastened to the frontier, and won four victories in ten days.
But he could not recover Kamieniec, and when the tuszenia pos-
polite met at Golenba and ordered an inquiry into the conduct
of Sobieski and his accomplices he frustrated all their efforts by
summoning a counter confederation to meet at Szczebrzeszyn.
Powerless to oppose a rebel who was at the same time com-
mander-in-chief, both the king and the diet had to give way, and
a compromise was come to whereby the peace of Buczacz was
repudiated and Sobieski was given a chance of rehabihtating
himself, which he did by his bnllant victory over an immense
Turkish host at Khotin (Nov. 10, 1673). The same day King
Michael died and Sobieski, determined to secure the throne
for himself, hastened to the capital, though Tatar bands were
swarming over the frontier and the whole situation was acutely
perilous. Appearing at the elective diet of 1674 at the head
of 6000 veterans he overawed every other competitor, and
despite the persistent opposition of the Lithuanians was elected
king on the 21st of May. By this time, however, the state of
things in the Ukraine was so alarming that the new king had to
hasten to the front. Assisted by French diplomacy at the Porte
(Louis XIV. desiring to employ Poland against Austna), and his
own skilful negotiations with the Tatar khan, John III now
tried to follow the example of Wladislaus IV. by leaving the
guardianship of the Ukraine entirely in the hands of the Cossacks,
while he assembled as many regulars and militiamen as possible
at Lemberg, whence he might hasten with adequate forces to
defend whichever of the provinces of the Republic might be in
most danger. But the appeal of the king was lke the voice of
one crying in the wilderness, and not one gentleman in a hundred
hastened to the assistance of the fatherland Even at the end
of August Sobieski had but 3000 men at his disposal to oppose to
60,000 Turks Only his superb strategy and the heroic devo-
tion of his lieutenants—notably the converted Jew, Jan Samuel
Chrzanowski, who held the Ottoman army at bay for eleven days

behind the walls of Trembowla—enabled the king to remove
“the pagan yoke from our shoulders ’’, and he returned to be
crowned at Cracow on the 14th of February 1676. In October
1676, in his entrenched camp at Zaravno, he with 13,000 men
withstood 80,000 Turks for three weeks, and recovered by special
treaty two-thirds of the Ukraine, but without Kamienrec (treaty
of Zaravno, Oct. 16, 1676).

Having now secured peace abroad Sobieski was desirous of
strengthening Poland at home by establishing absolute mon-
archy, but Louis XIV. looked coldly on the project, and from
this time forth the old familiar relations between the republic
and the French monarchy were strained to breaking point,
though the final rupture did not come till 1682 on the arrival
of the Austrian minister, Zerowski, at Warsaw. After resisting
every attempt of the French court to draw him into the anti-
Habsburg league, Sobicski signed the famous treaty of alhance
with the emperor Leopold against the Turks (March 31, 1683),
which was the prelude to the most glorious episode of his hfe,
the relief of Vienna and the hberation of Hungary from the
Ottoman yoke. The epoch-making victory of the 12th of Sep-
tember 1683 was ultimately decided by the charge of the Polish
cavalry led by Sobieski in person. Unfortunately Poland
profited little or nothing by this great triumph, and now that
she had broken the back of the enemy she was left to fight
the common enemy in the Ukraine with whatever assistance
she could obtain from the unwilling and unready Muscovites
The last twelve years of the reign of John III. were a period of
unmitigated humiliation and disaster. He now reaped to the
full the harvest of treason and rebellion which he himself had
sown so abundantly during the first forty years of his life. A
treasonable senate secretly plotting his dethronement, a mutinous
diet rejecting the most necessary reforms for fear of “ absolu-
tism,”’ ungrateful allies who profited exclusively by his victories
—these were his inseparable companions during the remainder of
his life. Nay, at last his evil destiny pursued him to the battle-
field and his own home. His last campaign (in 1690) was an
utter failure, and the last years of his hfe were embittered
by the violence and the intrigues of his dotingly beloved wife,
Marya Kazimiera d’Arquien, by whom he had three sons,
James, Alexander and Constantine. He died on the 17th of
June 1696, a disillusioned and broken-hearted old man.

JOHN I. (1357-1433), king of Portugal, the natural son of
Pedro I. (el Justicserro), was born at Lisbon on the 22nd of
April 1357, and in 1364 was created grand master of Aviz. On
the death of his lawful brother Ferdinand I., without male issue,
in October 1383, strenuous efforts were made to secure the
succession for Beatrice, the only child of Ferdinand I , who as
heiress-apparent had been married to John I. of Castile (Spain),
but the popular voice declared against an arrangement by which
Portugal would virtually have become a Spanish province, and
John was after violent tumults proclaimed protector and regent
in the following December. In April 1385 he was unanimously
chosen king by the estates of the realm at Coimbra. The king of
Castile invaded Portugal, but his army was compelled by
pestilence to withdraw, and subsequently by the decisive
battle of Aljubarrota (Aug. 14, 1385) the stability of John’s
throne was permanently secured. Hostilities continued inter-
mittently until John of Castile died, without leaving issue by
Beatrice, in 1390. Meanwhile the king of Portugal went on
consolidating the power of the crown at home and the influence
of the nation abroad. In 1415 Ceuta was taken from the Moors
by his sons who had been born to him by his wife Philippa,
daughter of John, duke of Lancaster, specially distingumshed
in the siege was Prince Henry (gv ) afterwards generally known
as “the Navigator” John I, sometimes surnamed “ the
