You are extracting structured data from McClellan Committee hearing transcripts.

**INPUT CONTEXT:**
- These are Congressional hearing transcripts from labor investigations
- Pages contain witness testimony, questions from committee members, and exchanges
- Speaker names are often in all caps (e.g., "Mr. KENNEDY", "The CHAIRMAN")
- Text may contain references to other testimony, exhibits, or documents

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
Extract the page as structured XML with this schema:

<page>
    <title>IMPROPER ACTIVITIES IN THE LABOR FIELD</title>
    <number>11682</number>
    <testimonies>
        <testimony>
            <speaker>Mr. Kennedy</speaker>
            <text>Then the answer to the question as to whether you paid for the 4,800 rights...</text>
            <type>question</type>
        </testimony>
        <testimony>
            <speaker>Mr. Block</speaker>
            <text>Mr. Kennedy, I cannot answer something that I don't know what you are asking me.</text>
            <type>answer</type>
        </testimony>
        <!-- Continue for all exchanges on the page -->
    </testimonies>
</page>

**EXTRACTION RULES:**
1. Capture ALL dialogue exchanges in order
2. Normalize speaker names (remove excess caps, standardize "The Chairman" vs "The CHAIRMAN")
3. Preserve the complete text of what each person said
4. Classify type as:
   - "question" for interrogative statements
   - "answer" for responses to questions
   - "statement" for declarative statements or procedural comments
5. Include references to other testimony inline within the text
6. Maintain chronological order of testimony

**CRITICAL:**
- Do NOT summarize or paraphrase testimony
- Preserve exact wording (but fix obvious OCR errors if any)
- Include ALL speakers, even brief interjections
- Output MUST start with <page> tag
